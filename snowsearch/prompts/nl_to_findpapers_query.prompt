🔍 Task: Create a findpapers query string that best resents the provided natual language search

Your response must be returned strictly in findpapers query string format following the rules below

========================
🧾 Rules:
========================
- Each query term must be enclosed in square brackets and cannot be empty.
  Example: [term a]

- Boolean operators allowed are AND, OR, and NOT, and must be uppercase.
  Example: [term a] AND [term b]

- Operators must have at least one whitespace (space, tab, newline) before and after them.
  Example: [term a] OR [term b]

- The NOT operator must always be preceded by AND.
  Example: [term a] AND NOT [term b]

- Subqueries must be enclosed in parentheses.
  Example: [term a] AND ([term b] OR [term c])

- Terms can only be combined through boolean operators.
  Invalid example: [term a] [term b]

- Only one level of parentheses grouping is allowed. Nested parentheses are invalid.
  Invalid example: [term a] OR (([term b] OR [term c]) AND [term d])

- Only OR is allowed between parentheses groups.
  Invalid example: ([term a] OR [term b]) AND ([term c] OR [term d])

- Only OR and AND connectors are allowed, no AND NOT.
  Invalid example: [term a] AND NOT [term b]

- Mixed connectors inside a query or subquery are not allowed.
  Invalid example: [term a] OR [term b] AND [term c]
  Valid example: [term a] OR [term b] OR [term c]

- Use ? to replace exactly one character in a term.
  Example: [son?] matches "song", "sons", but not "son".

- Use * to replace zero or more characters at the end of a term, with at least 3 preceding characters.
  Example: [son*] matches "son", "song", "sons", "sonic".

- Wildcards cannot be used at the start of a term.

- Wildcards can only be used in single terms and only one wildcard per term.

Examples:

Query                                            | Valid?
-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
[term a]                                         | Yes
([term a] OR [term b])                           | Yes
[term a] OR [term b]                             | Yes
[term a] AND [term b]                            | Yes
[term a] AND NOT ([term b] OR [term c])          | Yes
[term a] OR ([term b] AND ([term*] OR [t?rm]))   | Yes
[term a]OR[term b]                              | No (no whitespace between terms and boolean operator)
([term a] OR [term b]                           | No (missing parentheses)
[term a] or [term b]                            | No (lowercase boolean operator)
term a OR [term b]                              | No (missing square brackets)
[term a] [term b]                               | No (missing boolean operator)
[term a] XOR [term b]                           | No (invalid boolean operator)
[term a] OR NOT [term b]                        | No (NOT boolean operator must be preceded by AND)
[] AND [term b]                                 | No (empty term)
[some term*]                                    | No (wildcards can be used only in single terms)
[?erm]                                          | No (wildcards cannot be used at the start of a search term)
[te*]                                           | No (a minimum of 3 characters preceding the asterisk wildcard is required)
[ter*s]                                         | No (the asterisk wildcard can only be used at the end of a search term)
[t?rm?]                                         | No (only one wildcard can be included in a search term)

========================
✅ Example:
========================
([artificial intelligence] OR [AI] OR [machine learning] OR [ML] OR [deep learning] OR [DL]) AND ([music] OR [s?ng])

📌 Important Guidelines:
========================
- The final findpapers query must follow all rules described above.
- Do not add any extra explanation or text. Return only the valid findpapers query string.
- Do not hallucinate.
